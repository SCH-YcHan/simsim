# Project Rules

## App Structure Standard
- All new apps must follow the same folder structure as:
  `/home/user/adslab/categories/will-or-wont/animal-race`
- Required files inside each app folder:
  - `index.html`
  - `main.js`
  - `style.css`
  - `preview.png`

## Reminder
- When creating a new app, use the exact file naming above.
- Keep app assets and code self-contained within the app folder.

## Typography
- Always use the Pretendard font for all pages and UI.
